# Creating the variables
```{r}

height	<- c(59,60,61,58,67,72,70)
weight	<- c(150,140,180,220,160,140,130)
a	<- 150

```

# Step 1
```{r}
# Question 1
mean(height) # 63.85714

# Question 2
mean(weight) # 160

# Question 3
length(height) # 7
length(weight) # 7

# Question 4
sum(height) # 447

# Question 5
sum(height)/length(height) # 63.85714
## This outputs the same value as the mean function

sum(weight)/length(weight) # 160
## This outputs the same value as the mean function

```

# Step 2
```{r}
# Question 6
maxH <- max(height) # 72

# Question 7
minW <- min(weight) # 130

```

# Step 3
```{r}
# Question 8
new_weight <- weight + 5

# Question 9
weight_height_ratios <- new_weight/height
```

# Step 4
```{r}
# Question 10
if(maxH > 60) print("yes") else print("no")

# Question 11
if(minW > a) print("yes") else print("no")

```
